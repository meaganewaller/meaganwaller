# Inclusive

Compose globally-scoped Ruby modules into local packages. This makes it easy to access utility methods (aka functions) without having to type lengthy namespaces or remember which modules provide with functions at each call site (or alternatively include modules in your classes which pollute the method space).

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add inclusive

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install inclusive

## Usage

To start with, you can write your "package" (aka a standard Ruby module) containing a set of discrete functions. It's recommended you namespace your packages within higher-level modules.

```ruby
module MyOrg
  module MyPackages
    module WorkHardAtIt
      def just_do_it = puts "Don't let your dreams be dreams"
    end
  end
end
```

Then in any standard Ruby class, you can include the `Inclusive` module and use the `packages` class helper to "import" the package:

```ruby
require "inclusive"
# require the file(s) containing your package(s)

class GetToThePoint
  include Inclusive

  packages def work_hard = [MyOrg::MyPackages::WorkHardAtIt]

  def nothing_is_impossible
    work_hard.just_do_it # this will print out the motivational speech
  end
end
```

The import syntax is an array because you can import multiple packages. The imported packages will "compose" together, meaning the methods from the various package modules will all be available simultaneously.

In addition to creating instance methods using the `packages` class helper, you can use the `packages` method inline:

```ruby
def some_method
  my_math = packages[MyOrg::Math]

  my_math.multiply_by_100(5)
end
```

This approach isn't recommended unless you're in a context where using the class helper is impossible, such as a template (ERB, etc.) or a block which is executed by a framework. You can also call the `packages` method directly on the `Inclusive` module:

```ruby
my_math = Inclusive.packages(MyOrg::Math)
```

If you want to be able to call a package method directly on its own module, you can extend your module and use the `public_function` helper:

```ruby
module Packages
  module MyPackage
    extend Inclusive::Public

    def some_method
      # code
    end

    public_function :some_method
  end
end
```

Now in addition to using package imports via Inclusive, you can call the module method directly:

```ruby
Packages::MyPackage.some_method
```

This is only recommended if you need to mantain an existing module's legacy behavior in a codebase while incrementally adopting Inclusive.

### Packages Are Duplicated

One of the aspects of Inclusive which make it more useful than merely using standard Ruby modules is each imported package is actually a cloned module. This means a module can actually contain internal state, much like an object:

```ruby
module Packages
  module Ownership
    attr_accessor :owner

    def owner_classname
      owner.class.name
    end
  end
end

class SomeObject
  def try_out_ownership
    ownership = packages[Package::Ownership].tap { _1.owner = self }

    puts ownership.owner_classname # this will be `SomeObject`
  end
end

class SomeOtherObject
  def try_out_ownership
    ownership = packages[Package::Ownership].tap { _1.owner = self }

    puts ownership.owner_classname # this will be `SomeOtherObject`
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bin/rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bin/rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
