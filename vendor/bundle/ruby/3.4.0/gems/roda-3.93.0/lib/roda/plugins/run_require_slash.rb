    # The run_require_slash plugin makes +r.run+ a no-op if the remaining
    # path is not empty and does not start with +/+. The Rack SPEC requires that
    # +PATH_INFO+ start with a slash if not empty, so this plugin prevents
    # dispatching to the application with an environment that would violate the
    # Rack SPEC.
    #
    # You are unlikely to want to use this plugin unless are consuming partial
    # segments of the request path, or using the match_affix plugin to change
    # how routing is done:
    #
    #   plugin :match_affix, "", /(\/|\z)/
    #   route do |r|
    #     r.on "/a" do
    #       r.on "b" do
    #         r.run App
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   # with run_require_slash: 
    #   # GET /a/b/e => App not dispatched to
    #   # GET /a/b => App gets "" as PATH_INFO
    #
    #   # with run_require_slash: 
    #   # GET /a/b/e => App gets "e" as PATH_INFO, violating rack SPEC
    #   # GET /a/b => App gets "" as PATH_INFO
