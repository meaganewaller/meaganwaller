# 👑 Serbea: Similar to ERB, Except Awesomer

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/serbea.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/serbea)

**Serbea is the Ruby template engine you didn’t realize you needed. Until now.**

Serbea combines the best ideas from “brace-style” template languages such as Liquid, Nunjucks, Twig, Jinja, Mustache, etc.—and applies them to the world of ERB. You can use Serbea in Rails applications, Bridgetown static sites, or pretty much any Ruby scenario you could imagine.

**Documentation and examples are on our website:**
